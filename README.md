A batch refers to a collection of jobs that are processed data together

Batch systems is be the ideal solution in this scenarios 

   1. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
   2. Parallel Processing
   3. Data Migration
   4. Task Orchestration
   4. 24/7 Support
   
In this application, I implemented for both single process and multi-process jobs using spring batch partitioner.
